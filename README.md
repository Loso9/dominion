# Homework 1, PTS

*Hope that everything is working as it should (+ implemented classes closely to assignment diagram) and that I have correctly tested most of the classes.*

#### Review points and suggestions from Martin Hošek:

- fixing wrong Tests, which were not working due to non-determinstic methods, and adding unchecked possibilities ✔️
- implementing my own shuffling method instead of using *shuffle()* from *Collections* ✔️
(+ added *shuffling* boolean to decide, whether the DiscardPile is going to be native shuffling one or *NonShufflingDiscardPile*) ✔️
- implementing *NonShufflingDiscardPile* (+ adding *DiscardPileInterface*) ✔️
- instead of having both GameOver conditions in *AtleastNEmptyDecks* class (atleast N empty buydecks and empty province card buydeck), make *AtleastNEmptyDecks* cover atleast N empty buydecks condition and new class *EmptyProvinceDeck* for empty province buydeck condition ✔️️️
- some simple refactoring of code (access modifiers etc.) ✔️️️
